# B-Set (Bank Statement Expenses Tracker)

## Vision

To make everyone more financially stable starting with them being more accountable.

## About the project

This project is aimed at providing the people who want
to track their expenses but find it hard to record each
individual expense with a tool that takes their bank statement
and generates a bar graph for them of their spending.

You might have to include narrations before every transaction
you make though! (if you are detail-oriented of course) This will make it easier for to know what each
record was for.
